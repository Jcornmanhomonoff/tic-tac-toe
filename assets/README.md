GA WDI Project-1 - Tic Tac Toe

Github pages link: http://jcornmanhomonoff.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

Data Structure:
* I started by creating an HTML document that held the structure of my app. Then I proceeded to do some CSS to finalize the layout and add some basic styling. Next I attempted the game aspect of the app through jquery and javascript. I finished my game aspect with the game logic. Once I finished this I placed all of my buttons on my page along with the forms and coded the ajax.


User Stories:
* As a player, I want the page to be very user friendly(simple) so that it isn't hard to navigate.
* As a developer, I want my website to be responsive so that people can access it on the go.
* As a player, I want the page to be attractive and inviting so that I don't get bored.
* As a developer, I want the code to be as clean as possible so that another developer can easily read it
  and find their way around.


Issues:
* I struggled mostly with the PATCH method in ajax. I had difficulty defining what objects I had to pass through my functions.
* I tend to find that I have a lot of difficulty starting projects. I continuously went back and forth trying to determine what aspect to start first. Because of this, I think I had trouble focusing on one aspect of the project at a time.
* I find that once I sit down to work I have trouble stepping away. I think that this resulted in me struggling a bit more in solving problems I ran into over the course of the project.

Unsolved Problems:
* Originially, my creative spin was to have a football themed app. Unfortunately I ran out of time and had minimal to no time to work on my CSS and add any specific styling.
* * My nav looks horrendous.
* The app is semi responsive but still needs some work.
* I turned my click off after the game is with a win or a tie. The problem with this is that I was unable to turn the click back on once a new game was started.
